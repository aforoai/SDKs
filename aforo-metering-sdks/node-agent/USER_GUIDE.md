# @aforoai/agent-metering — User Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0 · **Updated:** 2026-06-29 · **Audience:** engineers instrumenting an AI agent (Claude, GPT, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or a custom loop) for Aforo billing and analytics.

## What you'll build

An agent run that opens an Aforo session, records each reasoning step and tool call with token counts and timing, and closes the session — with the events landing in your Aforo tenant. By the end you'll have confirmed a metered event arrived, not just that the call returned.

## Prerequisites

- Node >= 18 (built-in `fetch`). On Node < 18 you'll pass `fetchImpl` — see Step 2.
- An Aforo **API key**, a **tenant id**, and an AI_AGENT **product id**. These come from your Aforo console.
- An agent (or a stand-in script) whose lifecycle you can hook: where the run starts, where each step happens, where it ends.

## Step 1 — Install the SDK

Public install (once published):

```bash
npm i @aforoai/agent-metering
```

It isn't on npm yet, so for now install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aforoai/aforo-metering-sdks.git
cd aforo-metering-sdks/node-agent
npm install && npm run build
npm pack        # produces aforoai-agent-metering-1.0.0.tgz
```

Then in your agent project:

```bash
npm i /path/to/aforo-metering-sdks/node-agent/aforoai-agent-metering-1.0.0.tgz
```

## Step 2 — Create the client once per process

One `AforoAgent` instance is enough for the whole process — every session shares its flush queue.

```ts
import { AforoAgent } from '@aforoai/agent-metering';

const agent = new AforoAgent({
  tenantId: 'tenant_smartai',
  productId: 'prod_agent_001',
  apiKey: process.env.AFORO_API_KEY!,
  // ingestorUrl: 'http://localhost:8084/v1/ingest', // override for local dev
});
```

> ⚠ On Node < 18 there is no global `fetch`. The constructor throws `no fetch available` unless you pass `fetchImpl` (e.g. `fetchImpl: require('node-fetch')`).

The constructor validates `tenantId`, `productId`, and `apiKey` up front and throws if any is missing — so a misconfigured client fails at startup, not silently at flush time.

## Step 3 — Open a session at the start of a run

```ts
const session = await agent.startSession({
  agentId: 'agt_001',
  framework: 'CLAUDE',
  modelProvider: 'ANTHROPIC',
  modelName: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
});
```

This emits an `agent_session_start` event immediately and returns a session handle. The `framework`, `modelProvider`, and `modelName` you set here ride along on every subsequent step's properties — set them once.

> ⚠ If you don't pass a `sessionId`, the SDK generates one (`sess_…`). Capture `session.sessionId` if you need to correlate the run with your own logs — there's no way to look it up later.

## Step 4 — Record each step as the agent reasons

Call `recordStep` once per turn of the agent loop. Pass token counts and timing if you have them:

```ts
await session.recordStep({
  stepKind: 'TOOL_CALL',
  capabilityName: 'web-search',
  inputTokens: 320,
  outputTokens: 84,
  durationMs: 510,
  executionStatus: 'SUCCESS',
});
```

For the common case where the step *is* a tool call, use the shortcut — it stamps `stepKind: 'TOOL_CALL'` and the capability name for you:

```ts
await session.recordToolCall('web-search', {
  inputTokens: 320,
  outputTokens: 84,
  durationMs: 510,
});
```

> ⚠ A step carrying any token count emits **two** events — one `agent_step` and one `token_usage`. Steps and tokens are billed as separate metrics on the AI_AGENT product. Configure your rate plan against the metric you actually charge on; don't try to reconcile the two into one number.

Record a failed step honestly so error-rate analytics are real:

```ts
await session.recordStep({ stepKind: 'TOOL_CALL', capabilityName: 'db-query', executionStatus: 'ERROR' });
```

## Step 5 — End the session and flush

```ts
await session.end({ taskCompleted: true });
```

`end()` emits a final `agent_session_end` event (carrying the total step count and the task outcome) **and forces a flush**, so everything you recorded is delivered before the process can exit. If the run failed, say so:

```ts
await session.end({ taskCompleted: false, errorMessage: 'tool budget exhausted' });
```

> ⚠ If your process can exit between sessions without ever calling `end()` — e.g. you only use the low-level `agent.emitEvent(...)` — call `await agent.flush()` yourself before exit. A timed flush won't fire if the event loop is already draining.

## Step 6 — Verify it landed in Aforo

Watch the ingest call leave the process before you trust the dashboard. Point the client at a local catcher to see the exact batch:

```bash
# In one terminal — a throwaway HTTP echo that prints the POST body:
node -e "require('http').createServer((req,res)=>{let b='';req.on('data',d=>b+=d);req.on('end',()=>{console.log(req.method,req.url,b);res.writeHead(202).end('{}')})}).listen(8084)"
```

```ts
const agent = new AforoAgent({
  tenantId: 'tenant_smartai',
  productId: 'prod_agent_001',
  apiKey: process.env.AFORO_API_KEY!,
  ingestorUrl: 'http://localhost:8084/v1/ingest',
});
```

Run your Step 2–5 script. The catcher prints a `POST /v1/ingest` with a body like:

```json
{"events":[
  {"tenantId":"tenant_smartai","productId":"prod_agent_001","eventType":"agent_session_start","metricKey":"session_count","value":1,"agentId":"agt_001","sessionId":"sess_…"},
  {"eventType":"agent_step","metricKey":"step_count","value":1,"properties":{"stepKind":"TOOL_CALL","capabilityName":"web-search",…}},
  {"eventType":"token_usage","metricKey":"tokens_total","value":404,…},
  {"eventType":"agent_session_end","metricKey":"session_completed","value":1,"properties":{"stepCount":1,"taskCompleted":true}}
]}
```

If you see that batch, the SDK is wired correctly. Then point `ingestorUrl` back at the default (`https://usage-ingestor.aforo.ai/v1/ingest`) and confirm the step/session counts appear against `prod_agent_001` in your Aforo usage view. If the dashboard stays empty but the local catcher saw the batch, the problem is auth or tenant/product scope — see Troubleshooting.

## Configuration reference

| Option | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tenantId` | `string` | — (required) | Aforo tenant scope. Stamped on every event + sent as `X-Tenant-Id`. |
| `productId` | `string` | — (required) | The AI_AGENT product the events bill against. |
| `apiKey` | `string` | — (required) | Sent as `X-API-Key: <apiKey>`. |
| `ingestorUrl` | `string` | `https://usage-ingestor.aforo.ai/v1/ingest` | Full ingest URL; override per environment. |
| `flushBatchSize` | `number` | `50` | Buffer size before a forced flush. |
| `flushIntervalMs` | `number` | `5000` | Max buffer dwell time before a timed flush. |
| `fetchImpl` | `typeof fetch` | global `fetch` | Custom transport; required on Node < 18. |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `AforoAgent: tenantId/productId/apiKey is required` thrown at construction | A required config value is empty or undefined | Provide all three. The constructor fails fast on purpose. |
| `no fetch available — pass fetchImpl in config (Node <18)` | Running on Node < 18 with no global `fetch` | Pass `fetchImpl` (e.g. `node-fetch`), or upgrade to Node >= 18. |
| `[aforo-agent] ingestor returned 401` in the console; batch dropped | Bad or missing API key | Check `AFORO_API_KEY`. The key goes out as `X-API-Key`. |
| `[aforo-agent] ingestor returned 4xx`; dashboard empty | Tenant/product mismatch or unknown metric on the product | Confirm `tenantId`/`productId` match the AI_AGENT product, and that `step_count`/`tokens_total`/`session_count`/`session_completed` exist on it. |
| Process exits, no events arrive, no error logged | A timed flush never fired before exit | Call `await session.end(...)` (or `await agent.flush()`) before the process exits. |
| Token charges look doubled | Counting both `agent_step` and `token_usage` for the same step | They're distinct metrics by design — bill against one. |
| `[aforo-agent] flush failed; dropped N events` repeatedly | Network/DNS failure reaching `ingestorUrl` | Verify the URL is reachable from the agent host. Drops are not retried later — fix connectivity, or front the agent with a gateway plugin if drops are unacceptable. |

## What this guide does NOT cover

- **Guaranteed delivery.** Flush failures drop the batch with a console warning — no on-disk queue, no retry-later. If a lost event is unacceptable, meter through an Aforo gateway plugin.
- **Quota enforcement.** This SDK records usage; it does not block the agent when a limit is hit. Pre-flight quota gating lives in the MCP proxy (`@aforo/mcp-proxy --quota-enforcement`), not here.
- **Rate-plan / metric setup.** Creating the AI_AGENT product, its metrics, and its rate plan is done in the Aforo console, not in this SDK.
