## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29

Initial public distribution packaging — README, user guide, and versioning.

The SDK surface as documented at this version:

- `AforoAgent` client with `startSession`, `emitEvent`, and `flush`.
- `AgentSession` handle with `recordStep`, `recordToolCall`, and `end`.
- Direct buffered/batched emit to `https://usage-ingestor.aforo.ai/v1/ingest` (override via `ingestorUrl`), with `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` and `X-Tenant-Id`.
- Best-effort delivery: a failed flush logs and drops the batch.
