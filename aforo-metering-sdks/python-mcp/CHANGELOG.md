# Changelog

All notable changes to `aforo-mcp-metering` are documented here. This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Breaking (fix):** the tenant API key is sent as `X-API-Key` instead of `Authorization: Bearer`. The ingestor parses Bearer values as JWTs and rejected every request 401 (sending both headers is also 401), so no usage was being delivered.
- Docs and examples use the real ingestor host `https://usage-ingestor.aforo.ai` (`ingest.aforo.ai` / `ingestor.aforo.ai` serve a static site, not the ingestor).
- **Fix:** session heartbeats (`system.session.heartbeat`, quantity 0) are no longer sent in the usage batch; the ingestor rejects quantity 0 and failed the whole batch with 400. Session start/end methods are kept as no-ops/flush, heartbeat options are ignored.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29

Initial public distribution packaging — README, user guide, and versioning.

- Documented `AforoMcpBilling` and the `@billing.wrap_tool_handler` decorator: per-call timing, `SUCCESS`/`ERROR` status, and one `mcp_server.tool_invocations` event per invocation.
- Documented session heartbeats (`start_session` / `end_session`, periodic `system.session.heartbeat`) and the server-driven `killedSessionIds` / `on_session_killed` signal.
- Full configuration reference; events deliver to `POST https://ingest.aforo.ai/v1/ingest/batch` with Bearer auth and an `X-Tenant-Id` header.
