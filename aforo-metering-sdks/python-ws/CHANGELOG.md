# Changelog

All notable changes to `aforo-ws-metering` are documented here. This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-01

### Changed
- **`wsCloseReason` is cut on a UTF-16 boundary.** A close reason can carry text from the peer's close frame. `push()` already cut it to 32 characters, but counted code points, so a reason containing characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane could still exceed the ingestor's limit of 32 UTF-16 code units and the event was rejected. It is now cut to at most 32 UTF-16 code units without splitting a surrogate pair, and one WARNING is logged per client when a reason is cut. The event is sent, as before.

### Unchanged
- `customerId` is never truncated: a blank one, or one over 64 characters, still drops the event with reason `invalid`. `wsConnectionId` is sent as given (the connection trackers generate a UUID).
- The idempotency key does not contain the close reason.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- **2xx responses are read from the `{success, data}` envelope.** The ingestor wraps every 2xx JSON body, so `failed`, `errors[]` arrive under `data`. They were read at the top level, where they are never present, so events the ingestor rejected inside a 2xx response were counted as sent. A bare (unwrapped) body is still accepted.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-01

Merge of the public-repo fixes into the working line. Wire behaviour changes; read before upgrading.

### Added
- `product_type` constructor option (default `"WEBSOCKET_API"`) for the top-level `productType` the ingestor requires on every event, with a per-event override. Values are trimmed and upper-cased; values the SDK does not know are passed through.
- Drop reason `invalid`: an event that fails a client-side check is not buffered or sent. It is counted in `dropped_count`, logged at WARNING (once per distinct message) and passed to `on_drop(events, "invalid")`. `push()` does not raise for event content.
- Events the ingestor refuses inside a 202 response are counted in `dropped_count` and passed to `on_drop` with reason `rejected` (only the events the response identifies by index).

### Changed
- The API key is sent as `X-API-Key`; `Authorization: Bearer` is no longer sent. The ingestor accepts `X-API-Key` for every key type.
- Docs and examples use `https://api.aforo.ai`.
- A flush is split into requests of at most 1000 events (the ingestor's batch limit).
- Retry: 4xx responses other than 408 and 429 are not retried and drop the batch with reason `rejected`; 429 waits for `Retry-After` (capped at 60 s); 5xx, 408, 429 and network errors that fail 3 attempts drop with reason `retry_exhausted`. The ingestor's `errors[].message` is passed to `on_error`.
- Connection/frame duration is sent as `executionDurationMs`; the old `durationMs` field does not exist on the ingestor and was silently discarded. `push()` still accepts `durationMs` in its input.
- `wsDirection` / `wsFrameType` are normalised to the ingestor's allowed values and `wsCloseReason` is capped at 32 characters. Events with a blank or over-64-character `customerId`, or no `wsConnectionId`, are no longer sent; they are reported as `invalid` drops.

### Unchanged
- `executionStatus` rules, `on_drop` / `dropped_count`, the `atexit` flush, the `/v1/ingest/batch` endpoint, and idempotency keys (one per event, created when the event is recorded and reused by every retry).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-30

- An `executionStatus` outside the 11 accepted values (or longer than 20 characters) is logged and left off the event; it used to be sent and the ingestor rejected that event.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-30

- `executionStatus`, explicit only: `execution_status=` on `push()` and on the connection helpers (also settable inside the block); it goes on the `CONNECTION_CLOSED` event.

## 2026-07-05 (shipped under 1.0.0, no version bump)

- Drop observability: `dropped_count`, a WARNING log, and the opt-in `on_drop(events, reason)` hook (`retry_exhausted`, `rejected`). Dropped events keep their idempotency keys.
- Batches are POSTed to `/v1/ingest/batch`; `/v1/ingest/events` is a single-event endpoint and rejected every batch.
- `shutdown()` deregisters the `atexit` handler.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29

Initial public distribution packaging — README, user guide, and versioning.

- Documented `AforoWsBilling` and the connection trackers `track_websockets_connection` (for the `websockets` library) and `track_starlette_websocket` (FastAPI/Starlette).
- Documented the default open + close billing model (aggregated `messageCount` / `dataBytes` / `durationMs`), the `per_frame_events` mode, and close-code mapping via `WS_CLOSE_REASONS`.
- Full configuration reference; events deliver to `POST https://ingest.aforo.ai/v1/ingest/events` with Bearer auth and an `X-Tenant-Id` header.
