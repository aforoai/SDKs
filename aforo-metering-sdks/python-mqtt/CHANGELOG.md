# Changelog

All notable changes to `aforo-mqtt-metering` are documented here. This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-01

### Changed
- **An over-long topic or client id is truncated, not dropped.** `mqttTopic` and `mqttClientId` come from the MQTT traffic, whether a client wrapper reads them or your code passes them to `push()`. A topic over 500 characters or a client id over 128 (counted in UTF-16 code units; a surrogate pair is never split) is cut to the limit and the event is still sent; before, the event was dropped with reason `invalid`, so a long topic was not billed. One WARNING is logged per field name per client.
- **Idempotency key.** The key is built from the full, untruncated value. A key that fits in 255 characters is unchanged. When it would not fit, the over-long part is replaced in the key by its SHA-256 hex digest (the key used to be cut and given a random suffix), so the key is the same for the same input and differs for different inputs. The topic is replaced first, then the client id.

### Unchanged
- `customer_id` is never truncated: a blank one, or one over 64 characters, still drops the event with reason `invalid`. A missing topic (other than on CONNECT / DISCONNECT) and an unsupported `event_type` still drop the event.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- **2xx responses are read from the `{success, data}` envelope.** The ingestor wraps every 2xx JSON body, so `failed`, `errors[]` arrive under `data`. They were read at the top level, where they are never present, so events the ingestor rejected inside a 2xx response were counted as sent. A bare (unwrapped) body is still accepted.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-01

Merge of the public-repo fixes into the working line. Wire behaviour changes; read before upgrading.

### Added
- `product_type` constructor option (default `"MQTT_BROKER"`) for the top-level `productType` the ingestor requires on every event, with a per-event override. Values are trimmed and upper-cased; values the SDK does not know are passed through.
- Drop reason `invalid`: an event that fails a client-side check is not buffered or sent. It is counted in `dropped_count`, logged at WARNING (once per distinct message) and passed to `on_drop(events, "invalid")`. `push()` does not raise for event content.
- Events the ingestor refuses inside a 202 response are counted in `dropped_count` and passed to `on_drop` with reason `rejected` (only the events the response identifies by index).

### Changed
- The API key is sent as `X-API-Key`; `Authorization: Bearer` is no longer sent. The ingestor accepts `X-API-Key` for every key type.
- Docs and examples use `https://api.aforo.ai`.
- A flush is split into requests of at most 1000 events (the ingestor's batch limit).
- Retry: 4xx responses other than 408 and 429 are not retried and drop the batch with reason `rejected`; 429 waits for `Retry-After` (capped at 60 s); 5xx, 408, 429 and network errors that fail 3 attempts drop with reason `retry_exhausted`. The ingestor's `errors[].message` is passed to `on_error`.
- CONNECT / DISCONNECT events carry `mqttTopic` `$SYS/clients/<clientId>/<connected|disconnected>` instead of an empty string, since `mqttTopic` is required on every `MQTT_BROKER` event.
- `mqttEventType` must be one of PUBLISH / DELIVER / SUBSCRIBE / UNSUBSCRIBE / CONNECT / DISCONNECT and `mqttQos` outside 0–2 is sent as 0. Events with an unsupported type, no topic (other than CONNECT / DISCONNECT), a topic over 500 or client id over 128 characters, or a blank / over-64-character `customerId` are no longer sent; they are reported as `invalid` drops. Nothing is truncated.

### Unchanged
- `executionStatus` rules, `on_drop` / `dropped_count`, the `atexit` flush, the `/v1/ingest/batch` endpoint, and idempotency keys (one per event, created when the event is recorded and reused by every retry).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-30

- An `executionStatus` outside the 11 accepted values (or longer than 20 characters) is logged and left off the event; it used to be sent and the ingestor rejected that event.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-30

- `executionStatus`, explicit only: `execution_status=` on `push()`. The client wrappers do not set one.

## 2026-07-05 (shipped under 1.0.0, no version bump)

- Drop observability: `dropped_count`, a WARNING log, and the opt-in `on_drop(events, reason)` hook (`retry_exhausted`, `rejected`). Dropped events keep their idempotency keys.
- Batches are POSTed to `/v1/ingest/batch`; `/v1/ingest/events` is a single-event endpoint and rejected every batch.
- `shutdown()` deregisters the `atexit` handler.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29

Initial public distribution packaging — README, user guide, and versioning.

- Documented `AforoMqttBilling` and the client wrappers `wrap_paho_client` (paho-mqtt, sync) and `wrap_aiomqtt_client` (aiomqtt, async).
- Documented the metered event types (`mqtt_broker.publish` / `.subscribe` / `.unsubscribe` / `.connect` / `.disconnect`), the opt-in `emit_deliver_events` for inbound messages, and QoS/retained attributes for rate-plan tiering.
- Full configuration reference; events deliver to `POST https://ingest.aforo.ai/v1/ingest/events` with Bearer auth and an `X-Tenant-Id` header.
